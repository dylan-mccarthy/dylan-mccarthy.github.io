# Dapr Microservices Demo

## Introduction
Distributed Application Runtime or Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. Dapr enables you to build microservices applications that are portable across any cloud and any operating system. Dapr is a great tool for building microservices applications. In this post, I will show you how to build a microservices application using Dapr.

As DotNet is my prefered language I will be using that to create the services in this demo. Dapr has SDKs for many languages and frameworks. You can find the list of supported SDKs [here](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-bindings/supported-bindings/).

## Prerequisites
- DotNet 6.0
- Dapr CLI
- Docker
